# Public-Extension

A weekly log of handy [@SwiftLang](https://twitter.com/swiftlang) extensions. Created by [@jasdev](https://twitter.com/jasdev).

## Subscribe

To follow along, each extension will be tweeted from [@PublicExtension](https://twitter.com/PublicExtension) with sample usages and a link to the code in this repository.

## Structure

Each extension will be added to the Playground files in this repository (Public-Extension-[iOS|OSX].playground). Types that are being extended will have their own page!

To view the playground with rendered documentation, make sure to check 'Render Documentation' in the Utilities pane of Xcode!
